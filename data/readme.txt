My thinking with inluding these is that it's useful with some test data
so that the engine actually does something out of the box. I made everything
myself partly to not complicate licensing. I'm sorry for the coder art. ;-) 
One of the most important requirements was to keep the file size small, as to 
not bloat the repository. Hence the low resolution and heavy compression.
