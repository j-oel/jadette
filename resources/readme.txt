My thinking with inluding these is that it's useful with some test resources 
so that the engine actually does something out of the box. I made them myself 
partly to not complicate licensing. I'm sorry for the coder art. ;-) 
One of the most important requirements for them was to keep the file size 
small, as to not bloat the repository. Hence they are very low resolution 
and heavily compressed.
