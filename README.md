# Jadette - a DirectX 12 3D Engine.

The name Jadette can be interpreted as an acronym for Joel's Awesame DirEctx 
Twelve Three d Engine. It's maybe not exceptionally awesome yet,
but I thought that it could be good with some anticipation for the future. ;)

Anyway, it's mostly a vehicle for my learning of DirectX 12.

## Features

* Wavefront Obj file loader
* Two types of view control - first person free fly and orbit mode
* Picking, moving and rotating objects with the mouse
* Texture mapping
* Roughness, Metalness, AO maps
* Multiple lights
* Colored lights
* Shadow mapping
* Tangent space normal mapping
* Alpha blended transparent objects
* Alpha cutout objects
* Instancing
* Early Z pre-pass
* Vertex colors

This screenshot is from my standard test scene that is included in this repository 
(very basic models and textures to keep the size of the repo small):

## How to navigate the code

When I explore a new code base I like to start at the main function and drill my way down. I think this gives a good overview, but in some code bases there might be a lot of layers and what is the most interesting parts might not be immediately obvious, so it sometimes takes some time to find them. However, in the case of Jadette, this should be a pretty good exploration strategy for most people; the main function is located in the file [main.cpp](https://github.com/j-oel/jadette/blob/master/src/main.cpp). Nevertheless, If you're not so interested in Win32 specifics you could go directly to [Graphics.cpp](https://github.com/j-oel/jadette/blob/master/src/Graphics.cpp), which is where the high level graphics is controlled from. The functions *update* and *render* are central and good places to start further drill down from.

The file [Scene.cpp](https://github.com/j-oel/jadette/blob/master/src/Scene.cpp) is also really important and you will end up there pretty soon after Graphics.cpp. The most fundamental low level DirectX functionality, such as initialization, handling of the device and swap chain, is located in [Dx12_display.cpp](https://github.com/j-oel/jadette/blob/master/src/Dx12_display.cpp). The user interface is in [User_interface.cpp](https://github.com/j-oel/jadette/blob/master/src/User_interface.cpp) and [View_controller.cpp](https://github.com/j-oel/jadette/blob/master/src/View_controller.cpp). Low level input is sent from main.cpp to [Input.cpp](https://github.com/j-oel/jadette/blob/master/src/Input.cpp), which is used by User_interface and View_controller.


## How to build

Build with Visual Studio 2019. If you don't already have it, you can download the free Community version [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/). When installing, in "Workloads", select "Desktop development with C++" or "Game development with C++", they contain the Windows 10 SDK, which in turn contains DirectX 12, Jadette's only external dependencies. Then open Jadette.sln and select *Build Solution* from the *Build* menu (or hit the keyboard shortcut).
