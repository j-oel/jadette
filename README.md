# Jadette - a DirectX12 3D Engine.

The name Jadette can be interpreted as an acronym for Joel's Awesame DirEctx 
Twelve Three d Engine. Right now it's totally not awesome, quite the opposite, 
but I thought that it could be good with some anticipation for the future. ;)

Anyway, it's mostly a vehicle for my learning of DirectX12.

## How to build

Build with Visual Studio 2019.
