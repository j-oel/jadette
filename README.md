# Jadette - a DirectX 12 3D Engine.

The name Jadette can be interpreted as an acronym for Joel's Awesame DirEctx 
Twelve Three d Engine. It's maybe not exceptionally awesome yet,
but I thought that it could be good with some anticipation for the future. ;)

Anyway, it's mostly a vehicle for my learning of DirectX 12.
